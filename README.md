# Minecraft-Plugin-BungeeCord-Private-Message
This plugin is a Minecraft plugin for BungeeCord servers. It works in all versions of Java and Minecraft. It is translated into 7 languages. It allows the player from another server to send private messages to each other. Server administrators will then have the /spymsg command to be able to see what players are sending to each other.
